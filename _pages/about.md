Zhenhao Li is currently an PhD student in department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University (ISU). His interest is analog circuit design, chemelectric sensor, wireless power and data transfer circuit, & power managment circuit.

In 2019, he joined Dr. [Chenchang Zhan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/english-zhan-chenchang.html)'s group, Energy Efficient Integrated Circuit Lab (EEIC) at the [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and he was involved in the study and research of power management ICs design. From Jan. 2023, he started my PhD adventure with Dr. [Cheng Huang](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/chengh/), and he is currently focus on the topic about chemelectirc sensor circuits.
